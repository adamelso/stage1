Howdy!

Some time ago you signed up for Stage1's private beta. Today we are opening our
doors to our very private beta, for a very select few. Everything is still a bit
rough, but we are so excited about Stage1 that we want to share it right now,
and see what you will make out of it. We'd love to get feedback too.

So here's the deal, you get to use Stage1 for free for as long as we're in beta
(very private, private and public). In exchange, all we ask for is that you
actually use it, and give your most honest and detailed feedback.

Fair deal? Then jump in:

{{ url('app_core_beta_enter', { betaKey: beta.betaKey }) }}

In any case, do not hesitate to contact us for any question you could possibly
have, we are more than happy to help! Just reply to this email and start typing.

Best regards,
